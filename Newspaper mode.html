        <h1>American Bible Society Record, March 1990</h1>
        <div class="newspaper">
            Gaylord Zimbarami, the General Secretary of the Bible Society
            in Zimbabwe, tried to give a New Testament to a very belligerent
            man. The man insisted he would roll the pages and use them to
            make cigarettes. Mr. Kambarami said, "I understand that, but at least
            promise to read the page of the New Testament before you smoke it." The
            man agreed, and the two went their separate ways. Fifteen years
            later, the two met at a convention in Zimbabwe. The Scripture-smoking
            pagan had been saved and was now a full time evangelist. He told the audience,
            "I smoked Matthew, and I smoked Mark, and I smoked Luke. But when I got
            to John 3:16, I couldn't smoke anymore. My life was changed from that moment."
